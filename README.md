My World cup quiz

The World Cup Quiz app quizes the user on world cup trivia questions.

It consist of three activities.
Activity 1 asks the user to input a name to see the questions
Activity 2 contains the question (5 questions) which the user answers and submits.
Activity 3 then displays the result(how many questions were correct) and allows the user to view the answers (correct answers in green, wrong wnsers in Red).
Clicking OK takes the user to the first page of the app.

Here is a link to the APK on Google Drive
